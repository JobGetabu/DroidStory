## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up this library easily on your current project and working in no time. You only need a few configurations to start working!

## Installing

To be able to use the following library, you will need to add the following gradle dependency in your
#### build.gradle Project level

```
 repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
```

#### build.gradle  module

```
implementation 'com.github.JobGetabu:DroidStory:Tag'
```
That is the basic set up needed to be able to use the library in your applications!

## Permissions

First, we need to add these permission to our Android Manifest file :

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

That's it, you have set up the required permissions and ready to go!

## Usage


Take a look at this [sample](https://github.com/JobGetabu/DroidStory/tree/main/app) project which has a sample implementation of the library.
